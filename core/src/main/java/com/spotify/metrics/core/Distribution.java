/**
 * {@link Distribution} is a simple interface that allows users to record measurements
 * to compute rank statistics on data distribution not just local source.
 *
 * <p>Every implementation should produce a serialized data sketch in a byteBuffer
 * as this metric point value. For more information on how this is handled upstream,
 * Please refer to
 * <a href="https://github.com/spotify/ffwd-client-java/blob/master/ffwd-
 *  client/src/main/java/com/spotify/ffwd/FastForward.java#L110"/> FastForward Java client</a>
 *
 * <p>Unlike traditional histogram, {@link Distribution} doesn't require
 * predefined percentile value. Data recorded
 * can be used upstream to compute any percentile.
 *
 * <p>This Distribution doesn't require any binning configuration.
 * Just get an instance through SemanticMetricBuilder and record data.
 *
 * <p> {@link Distribution} is a good choice if you care about percentile accuracy in
 * a distributed environment and you want to rely on P99 to set SLO.
